lecture files 1, 2, 3 includes the codes preveiewed during the lectures. 
lecture file 4 includes the codes that answer the questions:
code1: Read protein sequence and print the total charge
code2: Read multiple protein sequences and print the total charge for each one.
code3: Read DNA sequence and print the sum of each of A, T, G, C.
code4: Read DNA sequence and print the percentage % of each of A, T, G, C.
code5i, code5ii, code5iii: Read protein sequence and print the percentage % for each aa.
code6: Read DNA seq and print the sister copy seq.
code7: Read coding DNA seq and print the triplets/codons.
code8i, code8ii: Read DNA seq and print the sum of AT.
code9: Read multiple DNA sequences and print the sum of AT for each one. 
code10: Read DNA sequence and print the percentage % of GC content. 
code11: Read DNAseq and print the sites of endonuclease PAMHI cutting sites. THe PAMHI cutting site is GGATCC.
code12: Read multiple DNAseq and print the sites of endonuclease PAMHI cutting sites. THe PAMHI cutting site is GGATCC.Doesn't work.
code13: Read DNA seq and check if it starts with ATG and ends in either TAG or TAA or TGA
